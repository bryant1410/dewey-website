You can also add Dewey to Chrome directly from our website, [deweyapp.io](http:/deweyapp.io).


# Launching

There are several ways to open Dewey.

## 1. Dewey Launcher
We highly recommend [Dewey Launcher](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dewey-launcher/fnfpnjjgpfifiilkencadlekjebpmbph), a small companion extension that puts a Dewey Icon in your browser next to the omnibox (i.e. the search bar) to quickly launch Dewey.

With Dewey Launcher installed, you can now create a keyboard shortcut to launch Dewey.

**Step 1.** Go to your extensions page via Windows > Extensions, or click on the 3-bar icon in the top right to Tools > Extensions.  
**Step 2.** On the extensions page, scroll to the bottom and click the "keyboard shortcuts" link:

## 2.  Put Dewey in your Bookmarks Bar
Make sure your [Bookmarks Bar](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95745?hl=en0) is visible. With Dewey open in tab, drag the little document icon in the Search Bar onto the Bookmarks Bar.

Selecting Show Apps Shortcut will put this in your bookmarks bar:

Clicking this will take you too Chrome's App page which shows you all your apps, like this:

# Navigating
Dewey organizes your bookmarks into a grid that continues to load as you scroll down. The layout is also fully responsive, so it still works well even if you need to use a narrow browser window.

- Use the Left/Right/Tab keyboard keys to navigate through the grid of bookmarks.
- When one of you bookmarks is highlighted with the bottom orange bar, hit enter to visit the link.

# Searching and Sorting
There are several ways to search your bookmarks with Dewey:

- A standard search returns anything with that word in the Tag, Title or URL.
- Add `tag:` before a word to limit results that have that specific tag applied.
- Add `title:` before a word to limit results to titles that contain that word.
- Add `url:` before a word to limit results to URLs that contain that word.
- Sort your bookmarks and your search results by Date, Title, or URL.
- Clicking a tag on a bookmark will run search of that tag.

# Editing
- Hovering over a bookmark reveals an Edit icon.
- Clicking the Edit icon opens the edit window.
- Within the edit window you can edit the Title, URL and custom tags.
- You can also delete a bookmark from Chrome.

# Options
There are two options for Dewey.

#### 1. Hide Top-level Folders
If you’d like Dewey to ignore Chrome’s top-level folders (i.e., Bookmarks Bar, Other Bookmarks and Mobile Bookmarks) click the Settings icon in the top right corner and check the “Hide top-level folders” box.

#### 2. Show Thumbnails
If you want Dewey to generate thumbnails for your bookmarks, enable or disable the feature here. If you decide not to show thumbnails, the color of your bookmark will be created from the colors within the link's favicon.
